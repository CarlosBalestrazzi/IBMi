# This line with '#' is a comment, the above line with '#!' is a Shebang, by which the shell knows which shell to use.
# We have used 'sh' shell on the IBM i which is mostly available by default, alternatively one may use 
# /QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/bash (to check if it's available, do a cd /QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/ if there are no errors, bash is 
# available on your IBM i)
